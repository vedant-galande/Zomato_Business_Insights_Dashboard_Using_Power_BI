## Recommendations
1. **Strengthen Customer Retention Programs**  
   With **33K users lost** compared to just **12K gained**, churn is a major issue. Loyalty programs, subscription models, and personalised offers based on order history **could help reduce churn** and increase customer lifetime value.  

2. **City-Specific Growth Strategies**  
   Delhi (**INR 106M**) and Bangalore (**INR 93M**) are top revenue drivers, while Hyderabad (**INR 26M**) and Surat (**INR 15.8M**) lag behind. Localised campaigns, regional restaurant tie-ups, and targeted promotions **could unlock untapped market potential** in underperforming cities.  

3. **Menu Optimization Based on Demand**  
   With **Veg orders at 156K** leading preferences, followed by **Non-Veg at 140K**, expanding vegetarian offerings while maintaining quality in Non-Veg items **could align menus better with consumer demand** and boost order volumes.  

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of **data-driven insights** in understanding customer behaviours, city-wise performance, and sales trends. By leveraging **interactive Power BI dashboards**, Zomato’s operations can be analysed more effectively to support **strategic decision-making, customer engagement improvements, and growth opportunities**.
